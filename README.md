# Dinosaurs Infographic

## Udacity's Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree

# Description

This project will build an infographic that is derived from the Dinosaurs data that is provided, as well as user input data (name, height, weight and diet).

This project will generate a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, it will display the name of the human rather than species and no fact.

When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden. The facts displayed will be random per dinosaur with 6 different types of facts.

One of the titles will be for a pigeon in which the tile should always display, “All birds are considered dinosaurs.”
